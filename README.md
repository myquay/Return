# Reader
The source code for my RSS reader hosted at [https://reader.michael-mckenna.com](https://reader.michael-mckenna.com/).

I think it's about time we took a good look at RSS again. By actively curating the sources you follow, you are in control of what is shaping your own view of the world. For too long we've left that up to the algorthims to decide for us.

This project is a simple RSS reader which presents a daily digest of articles from feeds you follow each day.

## Features

* **Simple to host:** Hugo powered static site based on the [Peripheral](https://github.com/myquay/hugo-theme-peripheral) theme hosted on GitHub pages.
* **No more refreshing:** Daily digest of new items generated overnight.
* **Easy to update:** GitHub Action powered by [FeedMD](https://github.com/myquay/feedmd) to generate the new markdown file.
* **Quick configuration:** Update config.yml with the RSS feeds to follow

## License

MIT - Fork it and do what you will. I hope this project helps someone start to follow the RSS feeds again.
